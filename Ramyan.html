Prince Rama, the eldest son of King Dasharatha of Ayodhya, is exiled to the forest for 14 years 
due to a series of events influenced by his stepmother, 
Queen Kaikeyi. Rama's wife, Sita, and his loyal brother, Lakshmana, accompany him in his exile. 
Rama forms an alliance with the monkey king, Hanuman, and together with an army of monkeys and bears,
 they set out to rescue Sita.

During their journey, Rama and his allies encounter various challenges and battles. They build a bridge 
across the ocean to reach Lanka, where they engage in a fierce battle against Ravana and his demon forces. 

With the help of Hanuman and his allies, Rama eventually defeats Ravana and rescues Sita. After their victory, 
Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana return to Ayodhya, where Rama is crowned as the king. 

The story of the Ramayana teaches important lessons about the values of dharma (righteousness),
loyalty, honor, and the power of good over evil. It is revered by millions as a sacred scripture 
and has been retold and celebrated in various forms of art, literature, and religious ceremonies  
throughout history.
